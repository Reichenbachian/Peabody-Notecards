Object association notes - 'Burial gifts included many broken bone tools and a beaming tool made from the cannon bone of a moose; the latter was placed between the knees....Other artifacts found in the grave include a trimmed beaver incisor, a small barbed point with two blunt barbs on one edge, and a fragment of a bone needle. Grave 1 was liberally sprinkled with red ochre; it covered the skeleton and the tools so that everything was deeply stained.' (Byers, 1979: 32) 'Included in the midden was a slate point with a square tang in which notches were rubbed and fragments of other slate points. A plummet and a fragment of an 'adz blank' shown with the grave may have been in the midden (Fig. 12.).' (Byers, 1979: 28) Excavator's remarks - 'Grave 1 was a flexed burial of an old adult male, lying on the left side, head west, face north (Fig.12). Although the the burial seemed closely associated with a hearth complex, there was no evidence that this was a burial beneath a hearth. Ash beds and many lenses of pebbles were noted, but none seemed to have been cut by the grave. The soil from the grave pit could be identified outside the burial feature for the pile was not completely used in refilling the grave. Although the pit just touched the IC.1 and IC.2 lines, it does not appear on the profile of either. The level from which the pit intruded included many small deposits of fish bones and scales.' (Byers, 1979: 28) General remarks - Fragments of an adult male found outside the grave boundaries may be from the adult individual in this grave.

A large and small plummet, a piece of incised bone and a fragment of celt in this supposed fill were not considered as grave goods....Two metapodial awls, made from bones split transversely and their distal ends shaved in the same plane to form broad flat tips, lay over the right arm with their proximal ends on the thin remnants of the frontal and parietal bones and their tips on the left arm. Two sharply pointed bone implements with a pronounced curve lay over the left arm. The bone from which they had been made could not be identified. About 15mm from the proximal ends of each were encircling shallow marks that could be vestiges of a wrapping or handle. Parallel to the left arm were two foreshafts for male harpoons, made of swordfish sword. One was made of a sword without cells, the other from a sword with cells that had been exposed when the sword was split. Diagonal lines about 2mm wide had been cut through the skin of the latter at irregular intervals. Below the foreshafts lay what proved to be a human [unclear as of 6/1995-LR] humerus, probably the left, from which the head (the proximal end) had been cut and the distal articular processes had been trimmed. A transverse hole had been drilled at the upper end of this implement--probably made from a left humerus. A single-barbed male harpoon with a gouged line hole lay near the northeast limit of the grave close by a small hammerstone and a decomposed piece of iron pyrite. From among the leg bones came a sliver of bone cut from a larger piece, possibly a needle in the first stage, with burrs of bone still attached. Pieces of curled birch bark were found in red ochre at the east end of the grave and at its northwest side.'

The grave lay in the pebbles and loam in which there were scraps of refuse bone. It seems probable that this layer once marked a living surface.'

Two sharply pointed bone implements with a pronounced curve lay over the left arm. The bone from which they had been made could not be identified. About 15mm from the proximal ends of each were encircling shallow marks that could be vestiges of a wrapping or handle. Parallel to the left arm were two foreshafts for male harpoons, made of swordfish sword. One was made of a sword without cells, the other from a sword with cells that had been exposed when the sword was split. Diagonal lines about 2mm wide had been cut through the skin of the latter at irregular intervals. Below the foreshafts lay what proved to be a human [unclear as of 6/1995-LR] humerus, probably the left, from which the head (the proximal end) had been cut and the distal articular processes had been trimmed. A transverse hole had been drilled at the upper end of this implement--probably made from a left humerus. A single-barbed male harpoon with a gouged line hole lay near the northeast limit of the grave close by a small hammerstone and a decomposed piece of iron pyrite. From among the leg bones came a sliver of bone cut from a larger piece, possibly a needle in the first stage, with burrs of bone still attached. Pieces of curled birch bark were found in red ochre at the east end of the grave and at its northwest side.'

The grave lay in the pebbles and loam in which there were scraps of refuse bone. It seems probable that this layer once marked a living surface.' (Byers, 1979: 38) General remarks - The burial was very well defined by red ochre and retained a high degree of integrity. Notes and catalogs show few conflicts.

About 15mm from the proximal ends of each were encircling shallow marks that could be vestiges of a wrapping or handle. Parallel to the left arm were two foreshafts for male harpoons, made of swordfish sword. One was made of a sword without cells, the other from a sword with cells that had been exposed when the sword was split. Diagonal lines about 2mm wide had been cut through the skin of the latter at irregular intervals. Below the foreshafts lay what proved to be a human [unclear as of 6/1995-LR] humerus, probably the left, from which the head (the proximal end) had been cut and the distal articular processes had been trimmed.

A single-barbed male harpoon with a gouged line hole lay near the northeast limit of the grave close by a small hammerstone and a decomposed piece of iron pyrite.

Object association notes - 'Burial gifts included many broken bone tools and a beaming tool made from the cannon bone of a moose; the latter was placed between the knees....Other artifacts found in the grave include a trimmed beaver incisor, a small barbed point with two blunt barbs on one edge, and a fragment of a bone needle. Grave 1 was liberally sprinkled with red ochre; it covered the skeleton and the tools so that everything was deeply stained.' (Byers, 1979: 32) 'Included in the midden was a slate point with a square tang in which notches were rubbed and fragments of other slate points. A plummet and a fragment of an 'adz blank' shown with the grave may have been in the midden (Fig. 12.).' (Byers, 1979: 28) Excavator's remarks - 'Grave 1 was a flexed burial of an old adult male, lying on the left side, head west, face north (Fig.12). Although the the burial seemed closely associated with a hearth complex, there was no evidence that this was a burial beneath a hearth. Ash beds and many lenses of pebbles were noted, but none seemed to have been cut by the grave. The soil from the grave pit could be identified outside the burial feature for the pile was not completely used in refilling the grave. Although the pit just touched the IC.1 and IC.2 lines, it does not appear on the profile of either. The level from which the pit intruded included many small deposits of fish bones and scales.' (Byers, 1979: 28) General remarks - Fragments of an adult male found outside the grave boundaries may be from the adult individual in this grave.
